        <h2>Introduction to Web Design</h2>
        <p>Suitable for complete beginners, this workshop will teach the absolute fundamentals of building web pages with HTML
          and CSS. By the end, participants will understand enough terminology, theory and application to build a simple
          standards-compliant website.</p>
      </li>

        <h2>What's a CSS Preprocessor and do we even need them?</h2>
        <p>CSS Processors such as Sass, Less and Stylus have existed for years as a way to 'power up' stylesheets with programming
          concepts and new syntax to developers. In this talk, we'll discover the history of these tools, some of the features
          they bring, and talk about their relevance in the wake of new and powerful CSS standards. In the workshop, the
          audience will also get started with Less and CSS counterpart features to understand the pros and cons of each.</p>

        <h2>What I discovered creating a virtual world - the good, bad and the ugly</h2>
        <p>In February 2018, I ran a 'massively multiplayer' version of the game assassin, where each player is given a target
          to 'kill'.
          <a href="http://spysmiths.glitch.me/">Spysmiths</a> immersed players in a ficticious world taking place on a university campus. As agents, they would
          recieve directives from 'HQ', and submit eliminations via SMS. In this talk, I'll share what we learnt about creating
          virtual worlds, including the strengths and weaknesses of ours, and the responsibilities to our players which we
          had not considered as facilitators.</p>
      </li>

        <h2>Styling emails with magic</h2>
        <p>It has always been notoriously difficult to consistently style HTML emails, despite being a technology which has
          existed for over 45 years. In this talk or workshop, we'll understand the history of styling email, techniques
          to make our emails pretty, and understand some of the current tooling available which takes away some of the pain
          in design, development and testing styled email.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>What's the deal with static site generators?</h2>
        <p>Traditional multipage websites often create page content dynamically using a database and a Content Management System.
          Instead, Static Site Generators create simple, maintainable, and secure websites with just the basic HTML, CSS
          and JavaScript which you would learn in a beginner web design class. In this workshop, you'll learn about tooling,
          templating, and possibilities to scale static websites in your personal or work projects.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>The joy of CSS Grid</h2>
        <p>Layout for the web has long been filled with hacky fixes for what you may assume are simple tasks. In this workshop,
          you'll get hands on with CSS Grid, understanding how to use it for both simple and complex page layouts, for responsive
          web design, and how it interacts with Flexbox. A working knowledge of basic CSS is required.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Meteor.js for front-end web developers</h2>
        <p>Meteor is a JavaScript framework which runs on both the client and server. This means that with one codebase, developers
          can have both parts of their applications seamlessly talk to each other. In this workshop, we'll build a very simple
          message board application and talk about Meteor best practice with the Blaze rendering system.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Understanding Conway's Game of Life, Turing Tests, and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>In this talk, we'll discover the amazing world of infinite cellular automaton. We'll see the steps between a simple
          game goverened by a set of mathmatical rules in less than 80 lines of code, and an Artificial Intelligence.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Making noise with JavaScript</h2>
        <p>In this talk or workshop, we'll use the Web Audio API to build a simple synthesiser which runs in any browser. Once
          we understand the basics, we'll learn how to combine this with buttons and sliders to get fine-grain control over
          the noises we create. Dependent on level and time, we may also introduce maximJs, a library which provides filters
          and timing control on top of the Web Audio API. A basic knowledge of programming concepts and JavaScript is preferred,
          but not required. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Making digital art with P5.js</h2>
        <p>P5.js is a JavaScript library used for creating digital art and used for teaching programming concepts. In this workshop,
          we'll build several examples together and learn how to create animations, interactive and generative art. Time-dependent,
          we'll also see how we can integrate a P5 'sketch' into a larger website.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Sending, recieving and dealing with SMS using Twilio</h2>
        <p>Twilio allows developers to send, receive and deal with SMS messages using a host of different programming languages.
          In this workshop, we'll use JavaScript to get started in each of these areas and use Twilio to build a simple text-based
          web browser.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Seeing the world around you with Clarifai</h2>
        <p>Clarifai provides tags of image contents. In this workshop, we'll use Clarifai's machine learning models and JavaScript
          to build a small mobile website which will allow users to upload an image and have the contents read aloud.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Building your first Chrome Extension</h2>
        <p>In this workshop, we'll be creating an extension which extends the functionality of the Chrome searchbox to autocomplete
          a Flickr search for users. With these skills, you'll be able to capture user input from the searchbox and apply
          it in other applications.</p>
